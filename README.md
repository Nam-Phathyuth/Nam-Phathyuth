## 💫 About Me: Certified Code Alchemis

> "The only code without bugs is the code you haven't written yet." - Me, prolly

Backend developer turning caffeine into code and minor typos into full-blown outages. Breaking production with a single commit since the dawn of time. When I’m not debugging bugs I created, I’m busy overengineering solutions for problems that don’t even exist... yet. 🚀🔥

- 🚀 Building highly available systems so they can crash in **style**
- Enterprise-grade architecture using the DDD Pattern (Definitely Dumb Decisions Pattern)
- Workflow? git commit -> git push -> blame frontend
- 🌱 My git commit history is just variations of "it works, don't touch"
- 💬 Ask me about how I fixed that bug (spoiler: I restarted the server)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first program was "Hello, World!"… and it had 3 CVEs, a memory leak, and a race condition 💀🔥
- 🦆 **Professional** rubber duck debugger (I am the duck)
